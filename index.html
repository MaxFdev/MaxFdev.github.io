                <h2>Introduction.</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Max, a dedicated technology enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science at Yeshiva University. 
                    With a deep passion for technology, I have immersed myself in the field to become a well-rounded professional. 
                    I successfully run two freelance businesses: one focused on IT consulting and the other on web design. 
                    You can find more information about these ventures below or on the About page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>Despite being in the early stages of my career, I have already completed exciting projects, including the development of this website, 
                    which serves as a testament to my capabilities. Further examples of my work can be found below or on the Projects page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>Alongside my technical experience, I have strong programming skills, primarily in Java. 
                    You can find a comprehensive list of my skills below and on the Skills page. 
                    While continually expanding my knowledge, I am particularly intrigued by fintech (finance technology) 
                    and actively pursuing further education in this domain.

                    <h3>Academics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since my enrollment at Yeshiva University in August 2022, I have been focused on pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science with
                        a specialization in distributed systems.  I have chosen to specialize in distributed systems to equip myself with the necessary skills and knowledge
                        for a future career in fintech (finance technology). Throughout my coursework, I have gained proficiency in fundamental programming concepts,
                        data structures, and algorithms. This includes leveraging tools such as Java and Python and mastering complex data structures and object-oriented
                        programming. Additionally, practical project experiences like "StockTerminal" have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, deepening
                        my problem-solving abilities and providing insights into the practical applications of distributed systems in finance.

                    <p>
                        As a driven entrepreneur, I have successfully established and managed two freelance businesses, leveraging my background and expertise in technology to
                        deliver exceptional results. In my IT consulting business, I offer a wide range of services, including complex software installation, custom data storage
                        solutions, and hardware upgrades.Through close collaboration with clients, I identify their unique technology needs and provide tailored solutions that
                        address their specific requirements. On the other hand, my web design business specializes in creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I
                        focus on responsive design and intuitive navigation to help businesses establish a strong online presence. By maintaining a client-centric approach, I am
                        committed to consistently delivering exceptional services for my clients.
